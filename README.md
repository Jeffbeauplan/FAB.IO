# FAB.IO

FAB.IO is your VR Financial Assistant Bot utilizing natural language processing. We built it to push the boundaries of digital banking with the alignment of Capital One Digital's goal to use smart design and technology to change banking for good. 

This was built within 24 hours during a Hackathon for Capital One's May 2017 Software Engineering Summit.
